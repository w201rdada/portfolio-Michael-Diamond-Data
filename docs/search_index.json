Abstract for “College Fit: the eHarmony for College Applications” Each year 2.5 million high school students will enter college and have to go through a process of evaluating, choosing, and applying to several institutions. The outcome of this process will determine, in part, how happy, fulfilled and successful they are over the next four years. This process is predicated on trying to establish the best “fit” between the student and the college they will attend. However, many factors ultimately go in to establishing this fit, and the prospective student does not have a strong analytical or algorithmic way of making the match. This project proposes using standard psychometric tests along with other questionnaire-based inputs to establish a link between individual colleges and the “types” of students who thrive and enjoy themselves at these institutions. The high school student applying to a college can take similar tests and fill in similar profiles to establish whether their target schools are a fit and/or to identify other schools which might be a good match for the student’s talents, interests, personality and goals. Abstract for “Video Choice” Providers of video services to the home and to networked devices, constantly face the challenge of capturing the attention of consumers and directing them to meaningful and relevant video content. At the same time, consumers in their homes, individually and/or in family groups are seeking out video content across multiple platforms that they can watch and enjoy together. With a plethora of choices available to the consumer, this project proposes an algorithmic and data-driven approach to matching available content with consumer interests. The project will help to reduce the time it takes to search for appropriate content, and reduce the complexity of navigating to and/or discovering the best choice.

["college-fit-the-eharmony-for-college-applications.html", "1 College Fit: the eHarmony for College Applications 1.1 Situation 1.2 Proposed Solution 1.3 Product Vision 1.4 Additional Business Opportunities", " 1 College Fit: the eHarmony for College Applications Keywords College, Graduation, Fit, Psychometric 1.1 Situation According to the National Center for Education Statistics, approximately 3.6 million students will graduate from high school in the 2017-2018 academic year. Traditionally, 69% (about 2.5 million) of these will go on to college in the fall after they graduate. All of these 2.5 million students must decide where they want to apply and where, ultimately, they want to attend - with over 4000 colleges and universities in the US alone, that’s a big challenge. 1 Graduating students face tough choices about which college would be the best fit for them academically, socially, athletically, etc. Legions of professional advisers – school-based, commercial, and online – have created an industry trying to help applicants find the right fit with colleges. For some students, the consideration set of candidate colleges is highly constrained because of financial or geographic limitations, along with whatever academic thresholds need to be met. For some students, the primary question may simply be: “Am I able to get in there?” or “Will I be able to afford this option?” Still, assuming students have more than one option to choose from, they need to evaluate their choices. This information gathering process is messy and does not work. Students in this condition must consider multiple factors about each institution, deriving information from a variety of sources including the candidate schools themselves, counsellors, family, friends, web search, etc. Students then have to evaluate what they learn from this information and weigh it against personal criteria about where they believe they would ‘fit.’ Further, college is an “experience good” in the sense that potential students have very limited data about what the actual experience of their academic and social life will be before they enter college and “consume” the service - they can ultimately only “evaluate by purchase”, at which point the decision is made. Substantial data about the student transfer rate (about 30% of students transfer) and the growing concerns about the mental health of students suggest that this process of choosing is far from perfect. An algorithmic solution could better use the data available to support students in this process. An algorithmic model capable of leveraging, analyzing and interpreting multiple large sets of data could improve this decision-making process and lead to better educational experiences and outcomes for future generations of students. 1.2 Proposed Solution In the most simplistic form the service requires two broad sets of data, College-side and Prospective Student-side. COLLEGE SIDE: The core components of what the college needs to track are: Define various outcomes, or measures of success, and then track these over time for individual students at their schools. For example, the results of survey questions like “How happy are you at Alpha College?”, or “How satisfied are you with your choice to attend College U?,” or “On a scale of 1-5 please rate your experience with…”, etc. Capture a psycho-social profile of their students as incoming freshman through a standardized tool like MBTI or DISC. Taken together with other aggregate data about the institution, this information could be used to construct a model to predict whether a certain student with a certain profile would be a “good fit” for each specific school. It gives us a model of what ‘type’ of people have thrived at that institution. In order to ensure the process reduces bias, i.e., prospective students are confident the data is not being selectively chosen or manipulated, this survey and analysis would be carried out by an independent third party; indeed this third party might be “College Fit” itself - to ensure the maximum ability to generate robust, comparable and explicable results. PROSPECTIVE STUDENT SIDE The key data we are trying to establish from prospective students are: Scores from key psychographic tests like MBTI along with responses to tailored questions about personality, perhaps drawing from the Big 5 Inventory of Personality, and some more descriptive factors about likes and disklikes. More categorical data about their up-front assumptions about areas of definition like “Big School” versus “Small School,” rural versus urban, etc. Additional ways to train this model The project will also include in additional available factors believed to affect the experience of students. There are a number of more informal websites like Ratemyprofessors.com which may help with broad categorization of an institution or an individual academic discipline. For sites like these, we will need to test several natural language processing algorithms. Further, we are interested in identifying what data on individual students already at the prospective college might be gleaned from their Social Media Graph and may provide further color on their likes and dislikes at their school and how that’s linked to their personality. In addition, College Fit would explore what synergies exist with the National Survey of Student Engagement, which measures many factors of student experience including questions like: “If you could start over again, would you go to the same institution you are now attending?” Strong summary metrics like these could be very helpful if they are found to be an accurate proxy for total experience at College. 1.3 Product Vision Students in the process of evaluating and selecting colleges would have a website or mobile application as the interface to College Fit. This tool would accomplish three principal tasks. 1. Gather Data Enable the student to take a standardized psychometric test like MBTI or answer a bank of individual selected psychometric questions. In additon, students will fill in some profile questions - demographics, hobbies, interests, etc. 2. Apply High Level Filters Students would be able to make ‘category’ type selections, e.g., colleges only in the Northeast or colleges over a certain size. However, students at this stage may be encouraged to use minimal filtering so that the algorithm can do its work. A prospective student may be surprised that many students “just like them” thrived at Big Ten Schools, for instance, when they had told themselves they had no interest in such institutions. 3. Present Recommendations Present 5 - 10 recommendations with some sort of justification or explanation, e.g., “We’ve selected this school for you because people who had a similar strong interest in the outdoors and considered themselves more extroverted, agreeable, and emotionally stable succeeded there.” 1.4 Additional Business Opportunities With the core data collection from current students evaluating their experiences, much of the insights gleaned could be re-packaged and sold back to colleges for other commercial opportunities. For example, to help universities evaluate what levels of services they need to keep students motivated and engaged. https://www.statista.com/topics/829/college-and-university/↩ "],
["video-choice.html", "2 Video Choice 2.1 Context. 2.2 Question / Problem to Solve 2.3 Key Units and Metrics to be evaluated. 2.4 Research Goal 2.5 An end.", " 2 Video Choice Keywords Entertainment, Video, Recommendation 2.1 Context. Providers of video services to the home and to networked devices, like cable companies, wireless phone operators, over-the-top streaming services etc., face the challenge of constantly (re-) capturing the attention of consumers and directing them towards video entertainment that is meaningful, relevant, and desirable by their “consumers” at the moment they wish to watch something. Similarly, families trying to watch together, or individuals alone, face an overwhelming choice with respect to their video entertainment options in the home, and on their ‘smart’ devices. 2.2 Question / Problem to Solve How could a company reduce the search time and complexity in finding a movie, or TV Show, that more than one member of the family could agree on, and be interested in watching together? How can they ensure that the result of search, is action and engagement? 2.3 Key Units and Metrics to be evaluated. A solution to this problem requires both a radical increase in the efficiency, or economy, by which information is gathered and a robust algorithmic approach to resolving the plethora of trade-offs that are required in the decision making process. In order to understand this question, one needs to identify the key units of study, which would include: - “Video Assets” (ie individual movies, TV episodes, etc) actively searched for and/or brought in to the consideration set for a family to review and choose. - “Individuals” (ie unique members of the family) and their specific choices, preference, prior viewing history etc. - “Platforms” (ie the software services and/or connected hardware) through which an Individual can ‘consume’ a Video Asset. With respect to the Video Asset, one would need to categorize its elements by three core elements: 1) Attributes that are ‘intrinsic’ to the property, in a sense non-mutable e.g., title, genre, length, cast and crew, release date etc ; 2) attributes that are ‘extrinsic’ i.e., attributed to the property by the platform or intermediary, for example price, format, platform availability, contains advertising/no-advertising, ‘rental’ period, / number of views etc.; and 3) attributes that are “evaluative” or judgemental such as consumer ratings, professional critical ratings, MPAA ratings, box-office performance if relevant, awards and honors such as Emmys, Oscars etc. Individuals would need to provide information on their preferences, previousl viewing history, actors and directors they like, subject matter and genre etc. For an analysis and assessment of the platforms, you would need a fairly extensive “product catalog” with details on the various assets in terms of format, pricing, useage rules etc. 2.4 Research Goal The initial phase of the research and analysis is to understand the decision making process, focusing specifically on what information is needed by the individuals involved, on which they tend to make a decision. This would be what is overtly observed or revealed, but an element of trade-off analysis might also reveal the implict choices consumers are making. Access to their actual viewing history and “ratings” applied to each asset would deepen the potential statiscal correlations. The goal of this stage is to determine what variables tend to be most discriminating in that they explain more of the variance in consumer appeal. Want to understand both how much the intrinsic factors drive choice versus the extrinsic and evaluative elements, and the interplay between these in making tradeoff decisions about the movie/TV show, that they could agree on. In addition we want to understand how “search costs” e.g., how difficult is it to identify where a certain movie can be consumed (ie Cable On Demand, AppleTV, Netflix, Hulu, etc) factor in to the ultimate resolution of whether a specific show is watched or not, or indeed if anything is ultimately chosen. Additional insights that could be collected to inform the decision-making process include: Search and Discovery, e.g., what can we learn from Google Searches, or IMDB ; Artifical Intelligence e.g., What can we learn from Alexa, or existing recommendations. 2.5 An end. From an ease of use perspective, the application (or service) could be customized up front, with any given preferences for parametes like platform (e.g., we prefer to watch on Netflix than Cable On Demand), or time available (e.g., we only have 1.5 hours). These would be used to constrain, or filter, the algorithmic recommendations and ensure that the ultimate results rendered, more closely correlate with expectations, and are instantly “actionable”. Ultimately trying to measure how satisfied the individuals in the watching group are with the choices recommended, or movies/TV shows chosen. Ultimately the results of this research would be an implementable application that would provide recommendations on compatible and appropriate video assets. "]
