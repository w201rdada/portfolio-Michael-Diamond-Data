## Context.

Providers of video services to the home and to networked devices, like cable companies, wireless phone companies, over-the-top streaming services etc., face the challenge of constantly (re-) capturing the attention of consumers and directing them towards video entertainment that is meaningful, relevant, and desirable by their “consumers” at the moment they wish to watch something.

Similarly, families trying to watch together, or individuals alone, face an overwhelming choice with respect to their video entertainment options in the home, and on their ‘smart’ devices.

## Question / Problem to Solve
How could a company reduce the search time and complexity in finding a movie, or TV Show, that more than one member of the family could agree on, and be interested in watching together.

## A middle.

In order to understand this question, one needs to identify the key units of study, which would include: 
- "Video Assets" (ie individual movies, TV episodes, etc) actively searched for and/or brought in to the consideration set for a family to review and choose.
- "Individuals" (ie unique members of the family) and their specific choices, preference, prior viewing history etc.
- "Platforms" (ie the software services and/or connected hardware) through which an Individual can 'consume' a Video Asset.

With respect to the Video Asset, one would need to categorize its elements by three core elements: 1) Attributes that are 'intrinsic' to the property, in a sense non-mutable; 2) attributes that are 'extrinsic' elements attributed to the property by the platform / intermediary.  Examples of intrinsic properties of a video asset would include title, genre, length, cast and crew, evaluative MPAA rating etc; and properties that are extrinsic would include variables such as price, format, platform availability, contains advertising/no-advertising, 'rental' period, / number of views etc.  and 3) attributes that are "evaluative" or judgemental wuch as consumer ratings, professional critical ratings, box-office performance, if relevant, awards and honors such as Emmys, Oscars etc. 

would also inform customers in making tradeoffs.

Decision making process.  What information is needed on which to make the decisions.  What variables tend to be most discriminating in that they explain more of the variance in consumer appeal.

Want to understand both how much the intrinsic factors drive choice versus the extrinsic elements, and the interplay between these in making a tradeoff decision.

What information presented. 
How might prior choices in this category.
Search costs e.g., how difficult is it to identify where a certain movie can be consumed (ie Cable On Demand, AppleTV, Netflix, Hulu, etc) 

How do criteria not intrinsic to the property, but to the platform or intermediary e.g., price, format, advertising/no-advertising, ‘rental’ period / number of views etc.

Additional insights that could be collected to inform the decision-making process include: Search and Discovery, e.g., what can we learn from Google Searches, or IMDB ; Artifical Intelligence e.g., What can we learn from Alexa, or existing recommendations.

Intrinsic to the property – subject matter, genre, date, MPAA rating, actors, awards won, box office, reviews, 


Measure.  Satisfaction surveys of the people watching the movies, ratings; but also an assessment of the process by which x
