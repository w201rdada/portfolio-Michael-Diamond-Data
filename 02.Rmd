## Context.

Providers of video services to the home and to networked devices, like cable companies, wireless phone operators, and over-the-top streaming services, must constantly (re-) capture the attention of consumers to ensure continued usage of their product. They have stiff competition; consumers face an overwhelming number of choices with respect to their video entertainment options in the home and on their smart devices. Providers are increasingly being asked to help direct users to video entertainment that is meaningful, relevant, and desirable at the moment users wish to watch something.
That becomes even more challenging when families want to watch something together - recommended content for any one individual may not appeal to the whole group. 

Using data science, providers can reduce the search time and complexity in finding a movie or TV show that a family would want to watch together. This keeps consumers happy and ensures that families continue to be engaged in the video products.

## Key Units and Metrics
Solving this problem requires broadband companies to gather consumer data more efficiently and use a robust algorithmic approach to predict recommend content at the group level rather than the individual level. 

The relevant units of study include: 
- "Video Assets" (individual movies or TV episodes) actively searched for and/or brought in to the consideration set for a family to review and choose
- "Individuals" (unique members of the family) and their specific choices, preference, prior viewing history, etc.
- "Platforms" (the software services and connected hardware) through which an individual can 'consume' a Video Asset.

The three core elements of the video are:
- 1) Non-mutable attributes that are **'intrinsic'** to the property (e.g., title, genre, length, cast and crew, release date)
- 2) Attributes that are **'extrinsic'**, i.e. attributed to the property by the platform  or intermediary. Examples include price, format, platform availability, contains advertising/no-advertising, 'rental' period, or number of views.;
- 3) Attributes that are **"evaluative"**, such as consumer ratings, professional critical ratings, MPAA ratings, box-office performance if relevant, or awards and honors.

Individuals would need to provide information on their preferences, previous viewing history, actors and directors they like, subject matter and genre, etc.  The platform would also need an extensive product catalog with details on the various assets in terms of format, pricing, usage rules, etc.

## Research Goal

The initial phase of the research is to understand the decision-making process of the family, focusing specifically on what information is needed by the individuals involved.
We are primarily interested in their final decision, but studying the trade-off analysis might also reveal the implicit choices consumers are making.  Access to their actual viewing history and the ratings they applied to each asset would deepen these findings. The goal of this stage is to determine what variables best predict consumer appeal.

Want to understand both how much the intrinsic factors drive choice versus the extrinsic and evaluative elements, and the interplay between these in making tradeoff decisions about the movie/TV show, that they could agree on.

In addition we want to understand how "search costs", e.g., how difficult is it to identify where a certain movie can be consumed (Cable On Demand, AppleTV, Netflix, Hulu) factor in to the ultimate resolution of whether a specific show is watched or not, or indeed if anything is ultimately chosen.

## An end.

From an ease of use perspective, the application (or service) could be customized up front, with any given preferences for parameters like platform (e.g., we prefer to watch on Netflix than Cable On Demand), or time available (e.g., we only have 1.5 hours).  These would be used to filter the recommendations and ensure that the results more closely correlate with expectations and are instantly actionable.

Ultimately trying to measure how satisfied the individuals in the watching group are with the choices recommended, or movies/TV shows chosen will be challenging.  Ultimately this solution provide recommendations on compatible and appropriate video assets to families, not just to individuals.
